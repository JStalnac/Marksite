# Marksite
A simple Flask application for writing articles etc with markdown
This is still just a framework for making webpages!

As you can probably tell from my writing I have an idea in the back of my head:
I made this as a kind of a school project because I wanted to write presentations in markdown instead of PowerPoint (yeah kinda funny lol)
I mean you have to say: It's pretty epic to show your work as a website and not as some PowerPoint presentation

## Usage
1. Go to templates/pages and execute make.py with the name of the article you want.
2. Go to the created folder and fill page.cfg and write your markdown to page.md
3. Go back to the folder where the scripts were and execute build.py with the name of the article.
4. Run the app and goto localhost/articles/<article name> in your browser to see the result!
